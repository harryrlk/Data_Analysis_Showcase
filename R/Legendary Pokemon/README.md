This is a comprehensive practice R project that analyzes a Pokémon dataset to predict whether a Pokémon is **Legendary** or not based on various attributes such as HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, and Speed. It covers the entire data analysis workflow, starting with **Data Cleaning & Preparation** (handling missing values and converting the `Legendary` column), followed by **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visualizations like bar plots, histograms, and correlation plots. The project also includes **Chi-Square Tests** to explore relationships between attributes. Finally, **Machine Learning Models** (including **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**) are built to classify Pokémon, with performance evaluated using confusion matrices and ROC curves. Additionally, **k-means clustering** is applied to segment the dataset into clusters. This project demonstrates the application of data cleaning, visualization, statistical testing, and machine learning techniques in a comprehensive workflow.
