## SKU Purchase Pattern Analysis

In this analysis, I focus on identifying typical repeat patterns in SKU purchases, using data from over 500 unique merchants and SKUs. To start, I select the top 10 merchants and SKUs to explore the trends and patterns between them.

### Purchased Pattern with SKU
By examining the order relations between SKUs and merchants, I observe the time elapsed between purchases, which helps identify recurring time patterns for each merchant's purchase behavior.

To improve the visualization and make the patterns clearer, I use a ![SKU Purchase Pattern](R/Retail%20Analytics%20for%20FMCG%20SMEs/SKU%20Purchased%20Pattern.png). The plot illustrates the 10 most common purchase sequences for the top 10 SKUs. Each color-filled block represents a purchase of a specific SKU, and repeat patterns are clearly visible. For example, sequence 3 shows a purple-red-orange pattern, sequence 5 shows purple-yellow-light blue
