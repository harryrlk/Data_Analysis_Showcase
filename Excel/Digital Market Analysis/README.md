# Digital Market Analysis - Excel Project

This project involves data cleaning, validation, calculations, and analysis of a sales dataset. The dataset contains deliberate errors and inconsistencies that need to be corrected and analyzed using Excel formulas. The project is divided into four sections:

## Section 1: Data Cleaning and Validation
- **Corrected Errors**: Fixed missing or incorrect dates using averages of previous and next entries. Standardized "Region" and "Salesperson" columns by removing typos and inconsistencies.
- **Data Validation**: Flagged rows with missing or zero values in "Quantity" or "Unit Price" in the new "Data Issue" column, with comments explaining the corrections.

## Section 2: Calculations and Analysis
- **Sales Amount Calculation**: Added a column for "Total Sales," calculated only for valid rows (non-blank Quantity and Unit Price).
- **Sales by Product and Region**: Created a pivot table summarizing total sales for each product and region, identifying the top-selling product and region.

## Section 3: Advanced Analysis and Logical Reasoning
- **Top 3 Salespersons**: Used formulas (not pivot tables) to identify the top 3 salespeople based on total sales.
- **Dynamic Discount Calculation**: Added a "Discount" column based on sales amounts using dynamic rules.
- **Error Check**: Highlighted transactions where the discount exceeded $300 using conditional formatting.

## Section 4: Decision-Making Scenario
- **Sales Performance Evaluation**: Compared actual sales with target sales for each region and identified regions that met or did not meet their targets. Provided a brief evaluation of which region needs the most improvement.

The Excel file contains all formulas and explanations, with comments added for clarity. This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and report on data effectively using Excel.
