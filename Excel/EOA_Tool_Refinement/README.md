# EOA Tool Refinement Project

**Scope of Work:** This project focused on updating and optimizing the HSC EOA tool to enhance its functionality and extend its capabilities. The work was divided into three phases: Quality of Life improvements, Calculation Adjustments, and Tool Cleanup.

## Phases:
- **Phase 1: Quality of Life**
  - Implemented surplus sharing with both options on a single file.
  - Extended formulas until 2050.

- **Phase 2: Calculation Adjustments**
  - Added subsidy calculation allowance for benchmarking.
  - Included a rental mix/AMR calculator tab.
  - Added new funding lines for revenue, expenses, and operating budgets.
  - Added additional subsidy line item.

- **Phase 3: Tool Settings Cleanup**
  - Updated parameter settings under the Tool Settings tab.

## Additional Ideas:
- **Reporting Outputs & Visualization:**  
  The project also included developing charts and graphs for reporting and client presentations. These visualizations were created using data from the schedule tab and viability rating dashboard. The delivery of these visualizations will be included in the Tableau section of this repository.

The final deliverable was an updated and modernized EOA tool, making it more efficient for future viability analysis and ensuring that the tool remains relevant for future use.
