# Excel Projects

This section showcases my proficiency in Excel, ranging from basic to advanced techniques. I am skilled in using foundational formulas such as `SUM`, `TRIM`, and `IF`, as well as advanced functions like `VLOOKUP`, `MATCH`, `INDEX`, and `PivotTables`. Additionally, I have experience creating dynamic visualizations and reports to communicate insights effectively.
