# Tableau Projects

This section showcases two Tableau projects: the **EOA Tool Refinement Project** and the **Foxit PDF Dashboard**. Due to NDA restrictions, I am unable to provide full access to the dashboards. However, I have uploaded images with mosaicked key information to give an overview of the visualizations created.

## 1. EOA Tool Refinement Project
- This project involved creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to support viability analysis using data from the EOA tool.
- The visualizations include performance metrics, trends, and key insights to facilitate decision-making. The mosaic images show a summary of the dashboard design.

## 2. Foxit PDF Dashboard
- This dashboard was developed to analyze the **US PDF market** and **Adobe**, the major competitor in this space.
- It visualizes **Foxit's current worldwide performance**, helping to assess market position.
- Additionally, the dashboard includes an **historic opportunity analysis** to identify growth potential and areas of improvement in the PDF market.
- The mosaic images showcase the design and key insights of these visualizations.

Remember, these dashboards are fully interactive. They are designed to allow users to click through to explore detailed information and gain deeper insights based on their selections.

Both dashboards are designed to provide actionable insights, drive strategic decisions, and improve data-driven processes. Feel free to explore the images to see the types of visualizations developed in each project.
