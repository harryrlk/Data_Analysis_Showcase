# Data_Analysis_Showcase
This repository showcases a selection of my data analysis and visualization projects, demonstrating my proficiency in using Excel, Python, R, and Tableau to tackle various data-related challenges. The projects here reflect my hands-on experience in the areas of data cleaning, statistical analysis, data visualization, and business intelligence.

Some of the projects included in this portfolio were conducted under Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), and as such, key figures, specific numbers, and sensitive data cannot be shared. However, I have included brief overviews and general insights to provide a look at the methodologies, tools, and outcomes involved.

The repository is divided into four sections:

	•	Excel: Featuring projects where I used Excel for data analysis, reporting, and automation.
	•	Python: Highlighting my work with Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
	•	R: Showcasing my work in R for statistical analysis, data manipulation, and visualization with ggplot2, dplyr, and other R packages.
	•	Tableau: Presenting interactive dashboards and visualizations created with Tableau to drive business insights and decisions.

This is my [resume][(documents/resume.pdf)](https://github.com/harryrlk/Data_Analysis_Showcase/blob/ee74f1f71009a8b9072421483ce708ca69725a46/Liankai%20(Harry)%20Ren.pdf) and [cover letter](documents/cover_letter.pdf).

Feel free to explore each section to see how I apply these tools to solve real-world data challenges. If you’d like to discuss any of the projects in further detail, please feel free to reach out.
