# Data Analysis Showcase

Hi! I'm Liankai (Harry) Ren, a Certified Business Analysis Professional (CBAP) with a Master's degree in Data Analysis. This repository showcases a curated selection of my data analysis, visualization, and machine learning projects, highlighting my expertise in leveraging tools like Excel, Python, R, and Tableau to address real-world business challenges. These projects demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, advanced visualization, and deriving actionable business insights.

Some projects were completed under Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), so I've anonymized sensitive data while providing overviews of methodologies, tools, key techniques, and high-level outcomes. Feel free to explore the folders for detailed code, notebooks, and visualizations.

The repository is organized into four main sections:

- **Excel**: Business-oriented projects using advanced Excel features like PivotTables, formulas, conditional formatting, and dashboards for reporting and automation.
- **Python**: End-to-end workflows with Jupyter Notebooks, focusing on data manipulation (Pandas, NumPy), EDA, machine learning (scikit-learn), and visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- **R**: Statistical and pattern analysis projects with scripts and R Markdown, emphasizing data wrangling (dplyr, tidyverse), ggplot2 visualizations, sequential mining (TraMineR), and modeling (randomForest, e1071).
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards and stories for stakeholder-driven insights, emphasizing data storytelling and performance metrics.

My background as a CBAP-certified professional ensures that my analyses are not only technically robust but also aligned with business objectives, stakeholder needs, and strategic decision-making.

I've also included my latest resume and cover letter PDFs in the root directory for easy access.

Explore each section to see how I combine technical skills with business acumen. If you'd like to discuss any project, collaborate, or connect on LinkedIn, feel free to reach out!
