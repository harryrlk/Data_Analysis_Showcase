# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes airline passenger satisfaction using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various features related to passenger demographics, flight experience, and satisfaction levels.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Imported the dataset and performed data cleaning.
   - Handled missing values and converted categorical variables into numerical formats.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed the distribution of satisfaction levels.
   - Visualized relationships between numeric and categorical features.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Applied **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** models to predict passenger satisfaction.
   - Achieved an accuracy of 86.33% with Logistic Regression and 94.42% with the optimized Decision Tree.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Used confusion matrices and ROC curves to assess model performance.
   - Identified key features affecting passenger satisfaction.

## Results
- **Logistic Regression**: 
  - Accuracy: 86.33%
  - Precision: 85.91%
  - Recall: 82.19%
  - F1 Score: 0.84

- **Decision Tree**: 
  - Highest Accuracy: 94.42% (at depth 11)

## Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates that machine learning models, particularly the Decision Tree, can effectively predict airline passenger satisfaction based on various features. Understanding satisfaction factors can help airlines improve their services and enhance customer experiences.
